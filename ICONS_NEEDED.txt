ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

The extension requires three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

QUICK SOLUTION:
You can create simple placeholder icons using any of these methods:

1. Online Icon Generator:
   - Visit: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - Upload any image or create a simple design
   - Download the generated icons in different sizes

2. Use an Emoji as Icon:
   - Visit: https://favicon.io/emoji-favicons/
   - Choose an emoji (e.g., 💬 speech balloon for comments)
   - Download and rename the files

3. Create Your Own:
   - Use any image editor (Paint, Photoshop, GIMP, etc.)
   - Create a simple design (e.g., a red square with white "XHS" text)
   - Export in the three required sizes

TEMPORARY WORKAROUND:
The extension will still work without icons, but Chrome will show a default extension icon.
You can load the extension first and add icons later.

RECOMMENDED DESIGN:
- Use Xiaohongshu's red color (#ff2442)
- Include a comment/chat bubble symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
